<h1 id="tensorflow-tipps">Tensorflow Tipps</h1>

<p>Although Tensorflow is well documented for its basic features, the documentation becomes rather sparse when coming to more advanced topics.
This blog post is a collection of best practice gathered from various Stackoverflow posts and Github issues over time.
Due to the frequently changing Tensorflow API, I can not guarantee that the ideas presented in this post will stay best pratice for a lon time.</p>

<p>Furthermore the aim of this post is not to introduce the basics of Tensorflow, as there already a great documentation exists.
Itâ€™s for people that are already familiar with Tensorflow and want to get inspired on how to write more efficient code.</p>

<h3 id="graph-definition-vs-execution">1 Graph Definition vs. Execution</h3>
<p>Well, to be honest: this is not really an advanced topic. 
But to write efficient Tensorflow code it is important to distinguish between graph definition and its execution: 
We use <strong>Python</strong> to describe a computational graph. 
This graph is actually executed in a session with fast <strong>C++</strong> implementations.
So whenever calling a function from <code class="highlighter-rouge">tf.</code> module you add a operation-node to the definition of the graph.</p>

<p>I like to do all the graph definitions in python classes:</p>
